/*Java Variables Typo
You have 5 variables in Java
Strings : Text - "Hello"
Integer : Int - Always WHOLE numbers
Boolean : true or false
Floats : Decimals - 19.999
Char : Single characters - "a" "b" "c"
How many charactors does pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis have?

In math if x=4 then 4=x
In programing if x=4 then 4 is assigned to x



x = "patty"
b = "tomato"
c = "cheese"
d = "bread"
e = "lettuce"
f = "ketchup"
g = "mayo"

So the template is : tyoe variable = value;
